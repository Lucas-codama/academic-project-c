# Academic Project in C (Free Market)

This repository contains an academic project developed in C as part of a technical high school course.
The project simulates a simplified online marketplace, similar in concept to Mercado Livre, implemented entirely in C for educational purposes.

## Context
- Developed during technical high school
- Focused on learning C language fundamentals
- Not intended for production use

## What this project demonstrates
- Modularization using multiple .c and .h files
- Use of structs
- Procedural, menu-driven program flow

## Limitations
This code reflects my skill level at the time it was written and prioritizes learning objectives over production-quality architecture.

## Build
Compiler: GCC
Example:
- cd scr/
- gcc -Wall -Wextra -g3 *.c -o main.exe
